# Paraphrasing Complex Network: Network Compression via Factor Transfer


## Requirements

To install requirements using [environment.yml](environment.yml) refer to the [documentation.](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)


## Training

[train_student.py](train_student.py) is the code for training student with pretrained teacher and paraphraser using **Factor Transfer (FT)**. 
To train the model(s), run this command:

``` 
python train_student.py  --cu_num 0 
```
